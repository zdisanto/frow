### What did we do? 
We created Frow's webpresence in a company organized Hackathon.

## Installation
You can simply visit Frow's website [here](https://zdisanto.github.io/frow/index/index.html) or you can go through the following steps to install Frow on your local machine:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository:
   
    ```https://github.com/zdisanto/frow.git```

4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
5. Open ```src/main/com/frow```
6. Run ```Frow.java```

- Java
- Spring Boot
- HTML, JS, CSS,
  - JPA, JSTL, Spring Tags, Lombok

## Extra Info
This was a three and a half day event where a whole website, front-end, back-end and database was needed to be created. If you want the Cart to work, go to ```designers>yeezy``` and select:
- Two VULTURES MASK
- One VULTURES LONG BLACK T
- One VULTURES PANT BLACK
- One YZY PODS
  
Scroll to the top and the cart will now have 5 items in it. Click it and you will see all five items. Needless to say, this was hardcoded.
